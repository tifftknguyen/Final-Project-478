# Tiffany Nguyen, Giselle Hernandez

1. Proposal
- Tiffany and Giselle had equal share in the work for the Proposal. Tiffany completed Problem Statement and Threat Model (Assets, Potentail Attackers, Attack Surfaces, Assumptions, Planned Defensive/Analytic APproach). Giselle completed the Success Metrics, Dataset / PCAP Plan, Risks and Ethics (Ethical, Legal, Privacy Concerns, Mitigation). Giselle and I both worked on the architecture together on draw.io.


2.  Format String Guardian
- Tiffany completed the safe sections and Giselle completed the unsafe section. We both HEAVILY used these notes in specific: 

Buffer Overflows_ Stack and Heap.pptx

Buffer Overflow Vulnerabilities and Mitigations in C Programming.pptx

Format String Vulnerabilities.pptx



- This main file went pretty smoothly thanks to the detailed notes. We had a slight issue with trying to run all the tests automatically because we wanted to find a way to automate everything instead of using a script. In the real world scenario, we assumed that it would be more beneficial to run things from the files directly instead of writing a script. (Please correct us if this is wrong!)
